# Taiwan district distance matrix

A Python Notebook to calculate the distance between districts in Taiwan.

The output file is not actually a matrix, I call it that for lack of a better name.ðŸ˜‚

## What are these JSON files?

### `taiwan_district_coordinate.json`

This file contains the coordinates of the districts in Taiwan. It's the input file for the notebook.

The data originates from [tw-area-json/position.json](https://github.com/xue-yuan/tw-area-json/blob/main/position.json).

### `taiwan_district_distance.json`

This file contains the distance between the districts in Taiwan. It's the output file of the notebook. It is 15 MB, so I will not upload it to GitHub. Instead, a zipped version has been uploaded.

If you prefer not to generate the file by running the notebook, you can download and unzip the [taiwan_district_distance.json.zip](taiwan_district_distance.json.zip) file and use it directly.
